## ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets Extension

JavaScript and React/Redux snippets in ES7+ with Babel plugin features for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Install It](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets)

## Prettier - Code formatted

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

Prettier - Code formatted

## Highlight Matching Tag

This extension highlights matching opening and/or closing tags. Optionally it also shows the path to tag in the status bar. Even though VSCode has some basic tag matching, it's just that - basic. This extension will try to match tags anywhere: from tag attributes, inside of strings, any files, while also providing extensive styling options to customize how tags are highlighted.

<Image
  src={highlightMatchingTag}
  alt="Highlight Matching Tag"
  densities={[0.5, 1]}
/>

## Auto Rename Tag

Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tag, same as Visual Studio IDE does.

ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

## npm Intellisense

## TabOut

## change-case

A wrapper around [node-change-case](https://github.com/blakeembrey/node-change-case) for Visual Studio Code. Quickly change the case of the current selection or current word.

<Image src={changeCase} alt="Change Case" densities={[0.5, 1]} />

[Install It](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case)

## EditorConfig for VS Code

This plugin [attempts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig#known-issues) to override user/workspace settings with settings found in `.editorconfig` files. No additional or vscode-specific files are required. As with any EditorConfig plugin, if `root=true` is not specified, EditorConfig [will continue to look](https://editorconfig.org/#file-location) for an `.editorconfig` file outside of the project.

[Install It](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
