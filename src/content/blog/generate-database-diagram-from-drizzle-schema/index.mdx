Welcome! In this guide, I’ll show you how to generate a database diagram from your [Drizzle ORM][drizzle-orm] schema using the [Drizzle DBML Generator][drizzle-dbml-generator]. Whether you’re working with Postgres or another database, these steps will help you visualize your schema quickly and efficiently.

To generate a database diagram from [Drizzle ORM][drizzle-orm], we will use the [Drizzle DBML Generator][drizzle-dbml-generator] package. This package takes your Drizzle schema and generates [Database Markup Language][dbml] (DBML).

Let's follow these steps to generate DBML from a Drizzle schema.

## Step 1 - Install Dependenices

Install [Drizzle DBML Generator][drizzle-dbml-generator] in your project.

```bash
npm i -D drizzle-dbml-generator tsx
```

> Before setting up [Drizzle DBML Generator][drizzle-dbml-generator], ensure that you have already configured [Drizzle ORM][drizzle-orm] in your project.

## Step 2 - Create Generator File

Now that we’ve installed [Drizzle DBML Generator][drizzle-dbml-generator], let’s create a file to run the generator. Create a dbml.ts file in your project and add the following code:

```ts
// dbml.ts
import * as schema from "./schema";
import { pgGenerate } from "drizzle-dbml-generator"; // Using Postgres for this example

const out = "./schema.dbml";
const relational = true;

pgGenerate({ schema, out, relational });
```

In this file, we import all tables and relations from your schema file as schema.

For this article, I’m using Postgres, so I’ve imported pgGenerate from `drizzle-dbml-generator`. You can use other generators as well.

The `out` variable refers to the output path for the `dbml` file. It’s relative to the root of your project, typically where your `package.json` is located.

Keep relational set to true if you want to link all tables together using the [Drizzle Relations][drizzle-relations] exports.

Now, pass `schema`, `out`, and `relational` as props to the `pgGenerate` function, and you’re done with this file.

## Step 3 - Run Generator

To run the `dbml.ts` file, let’s add a script to our `package.json`. Add the following script to the scripts object:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "dbml": "tsx ./src/dbml.ts"
}
```

Now, run the script from your terminal:

```bash
npm run dbml
```

After successfully running the script, you should see the `dbml` file in the specified location.

Now that we have a Database Markup Language file, we need a tool to create a diagram from this dbml schema. For that, we can use one of the following two Visual Studio extensions:

### 1. [DBML Live Preview][dbml-live-preview]

<Image src={dbmlLivePreview} alt="DBML Live Preview" densities={[0.5, 1]} />

### 2. [DBML Entity-Relationship Diagrams visualizer][dbml-entity-relationship-diagrams-visualizer]

<Image
  src={dbmlEntityRelationshipDiagramsVisualizer}
  alt="DBML Entity-Relationship Diagrams visualizer"
  densities={[0.5, 1]}
/>

And that’s it! You’ve now successfully generated a database diagram from your [Drizzle ORM][drizzle-orm] schema. Using [DBML][dbml] and the Visual Studio extensions, you can easily visualize and manage your database structure. Happy coding!
